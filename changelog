2.0.5
- Fixed a bug with the incorrect value showing up for "files remaining" and "files total" on the dashboard
- Fixed a bug where deleted files (offline deletions) were causing jobs to be held in limbo
- Optimized the process of scanning files (after the first scan) subsequent restarts should be much faster

- Fixed a bug with the dashboard not being able to handle negative (size increases) correctly
- Display the enc.Compression as +/- % change (+/- file size) now
- Display size on the finished table correctly
- Display "Created" correctly as a formatted timestamp
- Fixed a bug with the "Elapsed" time showing an incorrect value
- Fixed a bug with compression / avg encode duration stats being calculated on the wrong values
- Added a log file for the encoder workers (only keeping the current / last job run in the log file)
- Change "Created" on the finished table to "Finished"

2.0.3
- Wait for the initial startup scan to finish before doing anything else
- Speed up the insertion of new file entries
- Fix a bug with storage not displaying correctly

- Remove days from elapsed as it shouldn't be needed
